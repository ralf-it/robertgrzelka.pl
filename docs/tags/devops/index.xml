Introduction The quest for enhanced security in Kubernetes often leads to the integration of TLS certificates. Leveraging Cert Manager with Azure DNS and Let’s Encrypt simplifies this process, ensuring not only the automation of certificates issuance but also their renewal, enhancing the cluster’s security.</description></item><item><title>Azure DNS as external resource for SSL ACME Challenge to bypass Ingress Firewalls</title><link>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/azure-dns-for-letsencrypt-acme-challenge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Robert Grzelka</author><guid>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/azure-dns-for-letsencrypt-acme-challenge/</guid><description>Securing Web Services with Azure DNS: Mastering the SSL ACME Challenge Secure web services are non-negotiable, and SSL/TLS certificates stand at the forefront of this security. While Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt offers these certificates, procuring them becomes a complex task if your server is shielded by a firewall that filters out incoming internet traffic. The culprit? Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s ACME challenge requests. Thankfully, Azure DNS comes to the rescue, providing a smooth path to your solution.</description></item><item><title>Azure DevOps Pipeline Variable Types - Compile-time, Queue-time, and Run-time</title><link>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/azure-devops-variables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Robert Grzelka</author><guid>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/azure-devops-variables/</guid><description>Azure DevOps: Understanding Compile-time, Queue-time, and Run-time Variables Azure DevOps stands as a formidable platform for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
