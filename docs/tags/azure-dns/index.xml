Introduction The quest for enhanced security in Kubernetes often leads to the integration of TLS certificates. Leveraging Cert Manager with Azure DNS and Let’s Encrypt simplifies this process, ensuring not only the automation of certificates issuance but also their renewal, enhancing the cluster’s security.</description></item><item><title>Azure DNS as external resource for SSL ACME Challenge to bypass Ingress Firewalls</title><link>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/2023-10-03-azure-dns-for-letsencrypt-acme-challenge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 21:44:55 +0200</pubDate><author>Robert Grzelka</author><guid>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/2023-10-03-azure-dns-for-letsencrypt-acme-challenge/</guid><description>Securing Web Services with Azure DNS: Mastering the SSL ACME Challenge Secure web services are non-negotiable, and SSL/TLS certificates stand at the forefront of this security. While Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt offers these certificates, procuring them becomes a complex task if your server is shielded by a firewall that filters out incoming internet traffic. The culprit? Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s ACME challenge requests. Thankfully, Azure DNS comes to the rescue, providing a smooth path to your solution.</description></item><item><title>Azure Private Endpoints for Private Networking Ingress</title><link>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/2023-10-02-azure-private-endpoint/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 21:44:55 +0200</pubDate><author>Robert Grzelka</author><guid>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/2023-10-02-azure-private-endpoint/</guid><description>Networking is a crucial component of any cloud infrastructure. With Azure, you can design intricate network topologies that cater to various security, isolation, and connectivity needs. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to delve into Inbound Private Networking in Azure, focusing on Azure Private Endpoints and how they facilitate secure inbound connectivity.
What is Azure Private Endpoint? Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link.</description></item></channel></rss>
