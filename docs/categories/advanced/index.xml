As these resources grow in numbers and complexity, efficient and secure management becomes paramount. This is where Azure&amp;rsquo;s Service Principal, a unique identity created for use with applications, services, and automation tools, comes into play. Through this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll gain insights into how Service Principal can be a game-changer for managing access to Azure resources.</description></item><item><title>K8s use Cert Manager to generate TLS Cert with Azure DNS and Letsencrypt</title><link>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/kubernetes/k8s-cert-manager-azure-dns-letsencrypt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 21:44:55 +0200</pubDate><author>Robert Grzelka</author><guid>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/kubernetes/k8s-cert-manager-azure-dns-letsencrypt/</guid><description>Kubernetes Cert Manager with Azure DNS and LetsEncrypt Following my last piece on Azure DNS as external resource for SSL ACME Challenge, today, we are diving deep into securing Kubernetes clusters using the Cert-Manager to generate trusted TLS certificates, particularly for Nginx Ingress, with Azure DNS and Let’s Encrypt.
Introduction The quest for enhanced security in Kubernetes often leads to the integration of TLS certificates. Leveraging Cert Manager with Azure DNS and Let’s Encrypt simplifies this process, ensuring not only the automation of certificates issuance but also their renewal, enhancing the cluster’s security.</description></item><item><title>Azure AKS use Cert Manager to generate TLS Cert with Azure DNS and Letsencrypt</title><link>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/azure-aks-cert-manager-azure-dns-letsencrypt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Robert Grzelka</author><guid>https://robertgrzelka.pl/blog/azure/azure-aks-cert-manager-azure-dns-letsencrypt/</guid><description>Kubernetes Cert Manager with Azure DNS and LetsEncrypt Following my last piece on Azure DNS as external resource for SSL ACME Challenge, today, we are diving deep into securing Kubernetes clusters using the Cert-Manager to generate trusted TLS certificates, particularly for Nginx Ingress, with Azure DNS and Let’s Encrypt.
